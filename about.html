                    <h1>About Myself</h1>
                    <p> I was born in Shreveport, Louisianna, but lived overseas, specifically in China, for 10 years.
                        I attended Boston University and majored in International Relations. For the past three years,
                        I worked as a Customer Solutions Specialist in an insurance company called Plymouth Rock Assurance.
                        My whole life I have had to constantly adapt to new situations. As a Korean growing up in many 
                        different countries overseas, I am what is considered a “third culture kid” and have had to learn to adapt 
                        and succeed in any environment. I was constantly immersing myself in different cultures, providing me with many perspectives 
                        and a global understanding from ayoung age. That experience has proven invaluable as I often apply this mindset 
                        to the companies I work for.
                    </p>
                    <p> Outside of work, I am also on a dance team that gives me a space to explore my creativity through choreography, 
                        providing me the freedom to express myself through movement. Dance has taught me the significance of always 
                        being a student of the things I am passionate for. From watching videos and competitions on YouTube to 
                        spending countless hours training in fundamentals and applying those fundamentals in my movement, I find 
                        myself pursuing constant growth in this hobby, even seeking knowledge from many respected figures 
                        in the Hip Hop community to inspire and nurture my creative output. 
                        Though I am coming from a non-coding background, I am confident that my qualities and experience will allow me 
                        to thrive at Coding Temple as well as the industry. Whenever there is a dream I want to attain, 
                        I will undoubtedly do whatever it takes to make it into a reality.
                    </p>
